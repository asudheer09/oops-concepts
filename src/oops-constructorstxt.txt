OOPS:
====
.java ----> compile -->.class ----> when we run the program inside jvm there is class loader subsystem---> will load the class into jvm

Types of variables : 3
===============
1. Local ( method/ constructor /block)
	scope: within method/block /constructor
	default values provided by programmer.
	
2. Instance ( inside a class without static modifier)
	scope : when an obj is created that time instance will be created, when object is destoryed then instance 
	variables will be destoryed. 
	default values will be provided by jvm.
	for every object a seperate copy of instance varaibles will be created.
	
3. static ( inside a class with static modifier)
   at the time of class loading the static variables will be created.
   scope or life time : class 
   only one copy will be created that will be shared by all the objects.
   
   Constructor: is a special method.
   It provides values to the varaibles inside the class.
   
   In java we have 2 types of constructors
   1. default or zero arg-constructor  ( If we dont create any constructor in our class then jvm will create default constructor)
   2. parameterized 
   
   constructor rules:
   1. constructor name and class name should match.
   2. constructor does not have any return type include void.
   3. we can write any no of constructors in a class ( Constructor overlaoding)
   4. If we dont create any constructor then jvm will create default constructor.
   5. If we create any constructor then jvm will not create default constructor.
   
   
   // access specifiers
   
   private: we can access with in the class only
   public 
   protected
   default
   
   
  int  temp;
  
  private int i;
  
  public int j;
  
   a=10;
   b=20;
   
   a=20;
   b=10;
   
   temp=a; // temp=10;
   a=b; //a=20
   b=temp; //b=10
   
   oops:
   ====
   1. class
   2. object
   3. inheritance
   4. polymorphism
   5. encapsulation
   6. abstraction
   
 1. class : class is a blue print to create object.
 class is a logical entity.
 If we create a class you can create any no of object.
 class is not physically exist.
 
 Example : Car, Person, Employee, Flower,Student
 
 2. Object: is real entity.
 it is physically exist.
 we can create many objects using single class.
 object contains state and behaviour. (state =data /varaibles , behaviours=methods)
 
 3. inheritance: inheritance is the process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object.
 advanatge: code reusabilty.
 how to achieve this inheritence is using extends keyword.
 example:
  class A{
  
  //data
  //methods
  
  }
  
  class B extends A{
  
  // A data
  // A methods
  
  // B data
  
  // B methods
 
 }
 
 4. polymorphism
 
 poly= many
 morphism= forms
one name , multiple forms
one task can be perfromed in different ways.

2 types:
1. compiletime polymorphism ( example : method overloading)
2. runtime polymorphism  ( example : method overriding)
  
method overloading--> writing mulitple methods with same name but different arguements.
method overriding   --> re-writing the parent class method in to the child class.
 
 class A{
 
public void method1(){
}

public void method1(String a){
}

public void method1(int a){
}

}

class A{

public void run(){
}

}

class B extends A{

public void run(){
}

}
 
 5 Encapsulation
 =============
 wrapping of data and behaviours into single unit.
 
 Example: class : contains data and behaviours.
 
 The main advanatge with encapsulation is we can achieve security.
 So how we can achieve security is by declearing all the varaibles as private.
 If we declearing varaibles as private we cant access that data outside, so then we need setter and getter to access 
 that private data.
 
 6. abstraction
 hiding the unnecessary things and showing necessary things.
 example : ATM  ( withdraw , deposit, balance enquiry)
				car driving: 
 In java we can achieve abstraction using interfaces and abstract classes.
  
  
  In one project ---> we can create any of packages
  in one package ---> we can create any no of classes.
  
  package : group of related classes and interfaces.
  
  to create package : package com.company.hr;
